# Insurance Policy Management System - NXU Assignment

The Insurance Policy Management System is a Python project that simulates managing policyholders, insurance products, and payments. It is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming and modular design by separating functionality into distinct classes across multiple files.

This project provides a simple simulation of an insurance policy management system. It includes:

- **Policyholder Management:** Register, suspend, and reactivate policyholders.
- **Product Management:** Create, update, and suspend insurance products.
- **Payment Management:** Process payments, apply penalties for late payments, and send payment reminders.

The system is designed to be modular and extensible, making it a great starting point for further development or learning.

## Features
